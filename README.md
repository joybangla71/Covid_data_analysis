# Covid Data Analysis

This is a project that analyzes covid data compiled by JHU. First, the data was downloaded from here: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

Second, the total dataset(a giant CSV file) was divided into two tables: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations

Third, some introductory queries were performed using SQLQueries_COVID_dataset.sql to check the integrity of the data as well as to generate some interesting insights such as which countries have the highest percentage of positive tests per population etc.

Then, another file with similar queries was created to perform simple visualizations using Tableau. The SQL filename is: SQLQueries_for_tableau_viz.sql

The visulaizations are available in this link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anik.faisal/viz/CovidDataVisualization_16586897468950/Dashboard1
